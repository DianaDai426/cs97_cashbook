2/27 meeting update:
-Allan's implementation has been redone. We are using Emery's more clean
 implementation of the basic functions.
tutorial that Emery used:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1mdAPFq2Os&feature=emb_title&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org

-Decided to use the first repo, instead of the two split repos we had.

-each 'record' object will have these categories:
	Amount/Date/Use(Purpose)/Comments


We decided on these duties for these members:

FRONTEND:
Jon - Login/Register Page (~2:52 into the tutorial)

Diana - Page for entering data/ displaying it.
	implement add/delete/edit entry
 	'Sort by' drop down menu


Allan - Figure out how to get frontend to be able to call and use
	the backend methods. Then try to implement the report
	which shows users data (~2:08 into tutorial)

BACKEND:
Emery - Has already created fundamental methods. Don't forget to change
	it so that the date is added manually. Can try to make it so
	the sorting by date/amount/whatever is implemented.

NEXT MEETING:
THURSDAY, 3/4
