# Project Description

Our app is called MyCashbook. The user can register an new account and use this account to log in. After logging in, the user can create and delete notes that record their spending. Each notes contains the amount, purpose, date, and comment of the spending. The user can also delete the notes they no longer want. In addition, the user can sort the notes based on their dates, amounts, and purposes. The user can also go the summary page to view their spending split by different purpose categories.
